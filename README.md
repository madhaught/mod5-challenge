# mod5-challenge

Repo for bootcamp module 5 assignment.

In this repo there is a folder called data, within that folder there are two csv files that were used in data analysis on a study on mice. The code in the Starter_Code file is the code on which this assignment is modeled.

My code to complete this assignment is in the file "pymaceuticals_MH.ipynb". When I had questions that went beyond the scope of class I searched the internet for answers and commented the links above the relevant pieces of code. I also went to office hours to ask for help in the boxplots section.
